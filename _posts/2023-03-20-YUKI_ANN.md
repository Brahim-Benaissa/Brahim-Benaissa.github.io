Meta-heuristic optimization algorithms are popular and effective methods for solving complex optimization problems. They can help improve the performance of neural networks by optimizing their parameters:

    Can handle high-dimensional and non-linear optimization problems: Neural network training involves finding optimal values for a large number of parameters, which can be a high-dimensional and non-linear optimization problem. Meta-heuristic optimization algorithms are capable of handling such problems and can explore a wide range of possible solutions to find the best one.

    Do not require gradient information: Unlike traditional optimization algorithms, meta-heuristic optimization algorithms do not require gradient information to optimize the parameters of neural networks. This makes them particularly useful in cases where the gradient information is difficult or expensive to obtain.

    Avoid local optima: Neural network training involves finding the global optimum of the objective function, which can be difficult due to the presence of local optima. Meta-heuristic optimization algorithms use a stochastic search strategy that can help avoid getting stuck in local optima and find the global optimum.

    Can be easily parallelized: Meta-heuristic optimization algorithms are inherently parallelizable, which means that they can take advantage of parallel computing resources to speed up the optimization process. This is particularly useful when training large neural networks that require a lot of computational resources.

    Can handle noisy or incomplete data: In real-world applications, data can often be noisy or incomplete, which can make it difficult to train neural networks using traditional optimization methods. Meta-heuristic optimization algorithms are robust to such noise and can still find good solutions even with incomplete or noisy data.

They also have disadvantages when used in neural network training:

    Slow convergence: Meta-heuristic algorithms are designed to explore a large search space, which can make them slower to converge to an optimal solution compared to gradient-based methods. This slow convergence can lead to longer training times and make the algorithms less suitable for real-time applications.

    High computational cost: Meta-heuristic algorithms are computationally expensive, requiring a large number of iterations and evaluations of the objective function. This can be a significant disadvantage in large-scale neural network training, where the cost of each iteration can be prohibitive.

The code presented here implements a feedforward neural network with multiple hidden layers, with varying numbers of neurons. This neural network is initialized using random values in the range of [0, 1].

The neural network is then trained using the YUKI algorithm. The solutions generated by the YUKI algorithm are initialized based on the number of solutions required and the number of weights required for the neural network. Finally, the neural network is tested using the same input data to produce the output.
