## A Preprint Research

This framework remains in preprint status and has not undergone formal peer review. All findings, correlations, fits, and interpretations should be considered provisional and exploratory.

The <a href="https://justpeers.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Full Results and Computational Code</a> are provided for independent verification.

Critiques and attempts to reproduce/refute are welcome.

## The Problem of Galaxy Rotation Curves

The observed flat rotation curves, where stars maintain high velocities at large galactic radii, contradict the Newtonian predictions. This anomaly has presented a significant challenge to our understanding of gravity and the distribution of visible matter in galaxies.

The prevailing explanation invokes dark matter, a non interactive form of matter that permeates galaxies, providing the additional gravitational pull needed to explain the observations. However, despite extensive searches, dark matter remains undetected.

## Dark Matter visualization

 According to dark matter models, galaxies reside within vast, unseen halos that extend well beyond their visible regions, providing the gravitational force required to account for the high orbital velocities observed at large radii.

## Mezzi effect visualization

The mezzi effect is a relativistic observational effect that causes galaxies to appear compressed. This effect makes distant stars appear closer to the center than they truly are, which distorts the inferred distances and leads us to miscalculate their orbital speeds. By accounting for this distortion, the Newtonian model results align with observed flat rotation curves.

## First Shift in Perspective: It’s Not That the Outer Regions Move Too Fast, but That the Inner Regions Appear Too Slow

The Mezzi Effect provides an alternative interpretation of galaxy rotation curves. Instead of outer stars moving too fast, it proposes that the inner regions appear slower. When the velocity underestimation is corrected, the Newtonian predictions match the observed rotation profiles more closely.

---

## Second Shift in Perspective: No Missing Mass, Only Underestimated Mass

A compressed appearance can make galaxies seem smaller and fainter than they are, leading to an underestimation of their visible mass. Adjusting for this scale effect increases the inferred baryonic content, reducing the apparent need for additional unseen matter.

## Supporting Evidence

Analysis of 175 galaxies from the SPARC database shows that applying a relativistic scale correction can reproduce flat rotation curves using only visible matter. The resulting spatial curvature correlates strongly with general relativity’s predictions, suggesting the effect may reflect a genuine geometric property rather than only a fitting artifact.

## Questions to be Answered

- How robust is the correlation with Ricci curvature?
- Can the Mezzi scale factor be derived from first principles?     
- How does it connect to established relativistic phenomena?
- Will there be an Independent confirmation of SPARC results?     
- Can the SPARC data results results correspond to the Lensing observations?    
- Can the mezzi Effect be applied to galaxy custers?

## A Call for Collaboration

To astronomers, relativists, data scientists, and theorists: I invite you to test, challenge, and refine this idea. Whether you work with rotation curves, weak lensing surveys, or foundational gravity theories, your expertise is needed.

Let us collaborate on:

- Reproduce the SPARC analysis independently, using alternative mass models and fitting techniques.  
- Compare Mezzi-corrected baryonic maps with lensing mass reconstructions from Euclid, Rubin Observatory, or JWST.  
- Explore theoretical derivations of ξ(r) within Painlevé–Gullstrand geometry or other GR frameworks.  
- Apply the Mezzi scaling to cluster dynamics, can it explain lensing observation without dark matter?
