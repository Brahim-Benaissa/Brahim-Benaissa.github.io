## The Problem of Galaxy Rotation Curves

The observed flat rotation curves, where stars maintain high velocities at large galactic radii, contradict the Newtonian predictions. This anomaly have presented a significant challenge to our understanding of gravity and the distribution of visible matter in galaxies.

The prevailing explanation invokes dark matter, a non interactive form of matter that permeates galaxies, providing the additional gravitational pull needed to explain the observations. However, despite extensive searches, dark matter remain undetected.

## Dark Matter visualization

 According to dark matter models, galaxies reside within vast, unseen halos that extend well beyond their visible regions, providing the gravitational force required to account for the unexplained high orbital velocities observed at large radii.

## Mezzi effect visualization

The mezzi effect is a relativistic observational effect that causes galaxies to appear compressed. This effect makes distant stars appear closer to the center than they truly are, leading us to miscalculate their expected orbital speeds. By accounting for this distortion, the observed flat rotation curves align with observation.
