## The Problem of Galaxy Rotation Curves

The observed flat rotation curves, where stars maintain high velocities at large galactic radii, contradict the Newtonian predictions. This anomaly has presented a significant challenge to our understanding of gravity and the distribution of visible matter in galaxies.

The prevailing explanation invokes dark matter, a non interactive form of matter that permeates galaxies, providing the additional gravitational pull needed to explain the observations. However, despite extensive searches, dark matter remains undetected.

## Dark Matter visualization

 According to dark matter models, galaxies reside within vast, unseen halos that extend well beyond their visible regions, providing the gravitational force required to account for the high orbital velocities observed at large radii.

## Mezzi effect visualization

The mezzi effect is a relativistic observational effect that causes galaxies to appear compressed. This effect makes distant stars appear closer to the center than they truly are, which distorts the inferred distances and leads us to miscalculate their orbital speeds. By accounting for this distortion, the Newtonian model results align with observed flat rotation curves.

## Perspective Shift: Not the Outer Regions Too Fast, But Inner Regions Too Slow

The Mezzi Effect provides an alternative interpretation of galaxy rotation curves. Instead of outer stars moving too fast, it proposes that the inner regions appear slower due to a subtle spatial compression. When this geometric distortion is accounted for, Newtonian predictions align more closely with the observed rotation profiles.

## No Missing Mass, Only Underestimated Mass

A compressed appearance can make galaxies seem smaller and fainter than they are, leading to an underestimation of their visible mass. Adjusting for this scale effect increases the inferred baryonic content, reducing the apparent need for additional unseen matter.

---

## Occam's Razor  

The Mezzi framework remains within established physics, relying on relativistic geometry rather than new particles or modified gravity. If it explains observations with fewer assumptions, it offers a simpler and testable alternative consistent with Occam’s principle.

---

## Supporting Evidence

Analysis of 175 galaxies from the SPARC database shows that applying a relativistic scale correction can reproduce flat rotation curves using only visible matter. The resulting spatial curvature correlates strongly with general relativity’s predictions, suggesting the effect may reflect a genuine geometric property rather than only a fitting artifact.
